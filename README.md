# UnitTest_PushSwap

___

Hi, thanks to use my UnitTest for the 19 project named Push_Swap !

I still work on it but don't hesitate to create an issue to improve this UnitTest !

It will check some error cases, how many movement you do with 2, 3, 5, 100 and 500 values.

I built a little leaks chercker function too, it will facilitate you to verify your project.
